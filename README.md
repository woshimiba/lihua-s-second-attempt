lihua's  second attempt on Github.
I just entered university six months ago, and my mind was disturbed by the prosperity of the world a few months ago. Now my studies are on the right track, I have become more focused. I gradually discovered the fun of programming and learned by Bilibili's videos. This is a simple attempt, and I believe I can do better in the future. Thanks to the resources provided by the school and the Internet, in the next three or four years, I am sure that i will learn something to equal a job.
